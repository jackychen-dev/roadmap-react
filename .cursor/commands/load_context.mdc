# Load Context

This command loads conversation context that was previously saved using `save_context`. This allows a new agent session to understand the context, decisions, and progress from a previous conversation.

## What it does

When this command is invoked, you should:

1. **Determine which context file to load**:
   - If a specific file path is provided, load that file
   - If no file is specified, find and load the latest context file (by timestamp)
   - Context files are located in `.cursor/context/agent/YYYY/MM/` directories (organized by year/month)
   - Files follow the pattern: `context_YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS.md`

2. **Read and understand the context**:
   - Read the entire context file
   - Understand the user's goals, working style, and preferences
   - Review key decisions and their rationale
   - Note files that were created or modified
   - Understand patterns and conventions established
   - Review the conversation flow and next steps

3. **Apply the context**:
   - Use this information to understand the current state of the project
   - Respect established patterns and conventions
   - Continue from where the previous conversation left off
   - Be aware of the user's preferences and working style

## Execution

**Option 1: Use the helper script to find the latest context:**
```bash
python3 .cursor/context/agent/tools/load_context.py
```
This will print the path to the latest context file, which you can then read.

**Option 2: Find and read directly:**
1. Search recursively in `.cursor/context/agent/` directory (including year/month subdirectories)
2. Filter for files matching `context_*.md` pattern
3. Sort by filename (which includes timestamp) to find the latest
4. Read the latest file (or specified file if provided)
5. Parse and understand the content
6. Acknowledge that you've loaded the context and summarize key points

**Option 3: If a specific file is provided:**
- Read the specified context file directly
- Parse and understand the content
- Acknowledge the context has been loaded

## Usage Examples

- `@load_context.mdc` - Load the latest context dump
- `@load_context.mdc context_2025-11-07_08-38-27.md` - Load a specific context file
- `@load_context.mdc .cursor/context/context_2025-11-07_08-38-27.md` - Load with full path

## Important Considerations

- **Read thoroughly** - Don't skip sections, understand the full context
- **Respect decisions** - Honor architectural and design decisions made previously
- **Continue patterns** - Follow established conventions and patterns
- **Understand user preferences** - Adapt to the user's working style
- **Check for next steps** - Review recommendations and continue from there
- **Be aware of file changes** - Understand what files were modified and why
- **Context is cumulative** - If multiple context files exist, the latest represents the most current state

## Output

After loading context, you should:
1. Confirm which context file was loaded
2. Summarize key points from the context:
   - User's goals and current objectives
   - Important decisions and patterns
   - Current state of the project
   - Next steps or recommendations
3. Indicate that you're ready to continue from this context
