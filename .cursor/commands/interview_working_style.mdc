# Interview Working Style

This command conducts an interactive interview to capture your working style preferences and generates a `working_style.mdc` file that can be activated in future sessions using `@working_style.mdc`.

## What it does

When this command is invoked, you should:

1. **Run the interview script** to collect user preferences:
   ```bash
   python .cursor/context/agent/tools/interview_working_style.py
   ```

2. **Guide the user through questions** about:
   - Communication style (direct vs verbose)
   - Technical focus and depth
   - Education level and experience
   - Project vision and goals
   - Code style preferences
   - Error handling preferences
   - Documentation preferences
   - Testing preferences
   - And more...

3. **Generate working_style.mdc** in the `.cursor` root folder with all captured preferences

4. **Confirm completion** and explain how to use `@working_style.mdc` in future sessions

## Execution

**Option 1: Use the helper script (recommended):**
```bash
python .cursor/context/agent/tools/interview_working_style.py
```

The script will:
- Ask a series of questions interactively
- Collect all responses
- Generate `working_style.mdc` in `.cursor/` directory
- Confirm the file was created

**Option 2: Manual interview:**
If the script isn't available, conduct the interview directly in chat:
1. Ask each question from the script
2. Collect user responses
3. Generate the `working_style.mdc` file manually based on responses

## Questions Covered

The interview covers:
- **Communication Style**: Direct vs verbose, explanation depth
- **Technical Background**: Education, experience level, expertise areas
- **Project Vision**: Goals, priorities, constraints
- **Code Preferences**: Style, patterns, conventions
- **Error Handling**: Verbosity, recovery strategies
- **Documentation**: Level of detail, format preferences
- **Testing**: Approach, coverage expectations
- **Performance**: Optimization focus, trade-offs
- **Learning**: Preferred explanation style, examples needed

## Output

The generated `working_style.mdc` file will:
- Be saved at `.cursor/working_style.mdc`
- Contain all captured preferences in structured format
- Be ready to activate with `@working_style.mdc` in future sessions
- Instruct agents to keep these preferences in context for the entire session

## Usage

After running the interview:
- Use `@working_style.mdc` at the start of any new agent session
- The agent will read and apply your preferences throughout the session
- Update preferences anytime by running the interview again

## Important Notes

- **Be honest**: Accurate preferences lead to better assistance
- **Be specific**: Detailed answers help the agent understand your needs
- **Update regularly**: Preferences may change as you grow or projects evolve
- **Keep it current**: Re-run the interview when your needs change
